Files must be named city-mascot.png (I have exported all team logos as 500x500px PNG files - Example: "Metamora-Redbirds.png")
Run script from root of team logo directory. 
Two folders are created /logo as well as /text

### File Outputs
text directory: 
- away_team_city.txt
- away_team_mascot.txt, home_team_city.txt and home_team_mascot.txt
Inside of the logo directory you will output: away.png, away_color.png, home.png and home_color.png
